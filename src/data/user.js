			"I am a passionate developer keen on facing new challenges, because I believe challenges lead to growth. Over the last five years, I have been working on several projects with different startups within the agile environment mostly using Ruby on Rails but also other technologies like Node JS, Angular JS, Vue JS etc. My core derives me as becoming a developer and not a web designer . In fact, writing APIs is where I shine the most using my SQL/NoSQL knowledge. I always love to write clean, efficient code and also provide readable and reliable tests for each scenario.",

		description:
			"Over the last six years, I have worked on several projects with different startups in agile environments, primarily using Ruby on Rails, along with other technologies such as PHP, Node.js, Java etc. My passion lies in being a developer rather than a web designer. In fact, my expertise shines in writing APIs, where I leverage my knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases. Backend was my main focus in the past years but I also worked on many frontend applications in many companies using vanilla javascript, AngularJS, ReactJS and VueJS if needed. I am dedicated to writing clean, efficient code and ensuring each scenario is supported by readable and reliable tests. On a personal level, I consider myself precise, reliable, and collaborative. I am capable of creating and completing projects both independently and in group settings, optimizing resources while adhering to deadlines and priorities.",
